## 4. CONTEXT FOR AI GENERATION (META-INSTRUCTIONS)

* **When generating Art/Visuals:** Strictly avoid "High Fantasy" tropes. No wizards with wooden staffs (unless it's a cyborg-druid). No dragons (unless it's a robot). Focus on materials: Brass, Rust, Wood, Void.
* **When generating Voice Lines:**
    * *Concordat:* Disciplined, Latin-sounding, Military radio filter.
    * *Ferrum:* Grunting, loud machinery noise, shouting over engine roar.
    * *Coil:* Whispering, hive-mind distortion, squishing sounds.
    * *Entropy:* Reverse reverb, metallic scraping, glitchy/static voice.
